## My Project Euler

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context

## Why does this repository exist?
This is just a place for me to store and be proud of the problems I solved. Furthermore, it also serves the purpose of helping me keep track of my progress, both in maths and in computer programming.

## Disclaimer
The solution to each problem is verified using pre-existing katas on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
